# BsmartFlow - AIBoomi Startup Weekend Demo

## Problem Statement
For freelancers and solo-preneurs using Google Workspace, the process of manually creating an invoice from a project tracker is a repetitive, 5-10 minute task that is prone to copy-paste errors and drains valuable time.

## Users & Context
This tool is for the 100,000+ solo-preneurs, freelancers, and small agency owners in India who run their business on Google Workspace (Sheets, Docs, Drive) and need a simple way to automate their back-office tasks.

## Solution Overview
BSmartFlow is an AI-powered assistant that lives inside your Google Workspace. Our demo showcases the "Natural Language to Invoice" workflow. The user gives a plain English command to our chat-based assistant, which understands the command, finds the correct project data in a Google Sheet, and automatically generates a professional PDF invoice.

## Setup & Run
*(We will fill this in on Sunday. For now, leave this section as-is.)*

1.  **Prerequisites:** Google Account.
2.  **Access the Web App:** [PASTE YOUR APPS SCRIPT WEB APP URL HERE on Sunday]
3.  **Instructions:** Simply type a command like "Generate invoice for 'Logo Design'" and the app will do the rest.

## Models & Data
*   **Model:** This demo uses basic Natural Language Understanding (NLU) to parse user intent and entities from a text command.
*   **Data:** The project reads from a user-owned Google Sheet to get project details and uses a Google Doc as an invoice template. All data remains within the user's private Google account.

## Known Limitations & Risks
*   The current demo's NLU is rule-based and recognizes a limited set of commands.
*   The system currently only works with a pre-defined Google Sheet structure.
